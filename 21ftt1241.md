# Assignment 1: VPS Deployment Logbook
---
### 1. Setting Up SSH Key
1. Create an SSH key using ED25519 encryption and include your student email as the end comment on windows terminal / cmd / powershell

	```
	ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “<21ftt1241@student.pb.edu.bn>”
	```
	>Create a '.ssh' directory if needed using 'mkdir'
	
	- An SSH key with the name sop_as1 and sop_as1.pub will be generated inside your specified directory
	- use the command `type sop_as1.pub` in order to get the content of the key
	- Copy the content of the key and save it for the next step
  
2. Ensure the following details when generating the SSH key
	- Name: sop_as1
	- Type: ED25519
	- Have your PB Email as the key comment

### 2. Create Droplet server
1. Head over to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and create a droplet server
2. Ensure the following details are correct
	- HostName: sop-as1
	- Key: ==Copied key content from steps 1.2==
	> Keep in mind that the location of server region, cpu options and additional storage can be configured up to own preference
3. Before connecting to the VPS, allow the newly created SSH key to be identified by inputting the following command on terminal
	```
	ssh -i sop_as1 user@157.245.52.255
	```
	> Make sure when the command is in the same directory as the location of the SSH key
	
### 3. Setup new user
1. `adduser ftt1241`
2. Enable sudo privilege to new user
	```
	usermod -aG sudo ftt1241
	```
3. Enable external access for regular user by copying the authorized_keys on `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` root to targeted users direcotry 
	```
	rsync --archive --chown=ftt1241:ftt1241 ~/.ssh /home/ftt1241
	```

  
### 4. Server Setup
1. Edit config file inside the following directory `sudo nano \etc\ssh\sshd_config`, once inside do the following:
	1. Change the port to custom port, in this case it is `Port 1241`
	
	> **Important Notes**
	> Allow the new port number  to the firewall before proceeding to avoid issue `sudo ufw allow 1241/tcp`
	
	2. Disable the root login `PermitRootLogin no`
	3. Limit maximum authentication attempts to three `MaxAuthTries 3`
	4. Enable public athentication `PubkeyAuthentication yes`
	5. Disable password authentication `PasswordAuthentication no`


### 5. Setup nginx
1. Install Nginx to the server `sudo apt install nginx`
2. Allow nginx to the firewall rule `sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'`

## 5.1 Setup server blocks
1. Create a domain directory `sudo mkdir -p /var/www/sys_op_as1/html`
2. Assign ownership of the directory `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/sys_op_as1/html`
3. Set permission to the folder `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/sys_op_as1`
4. Create a welcome page `sudo nano /var/www/sys_op_as1/html/index.html`

	```html/index
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8">
			<title>SysOps Assignment 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
			Welcome to my website on my VPS on the cloud! <br> My ID is 21FT></body>
	</html>
	```

5. Create a server block and input the following

	```
	server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/sys_op_as01/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name sys_op_as01 157.245.52.255;

        location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
	}
	```

6. Link the file from sites-available to sites-anabled
	
	```
	sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
	```
	
7. Adjust hash bucket value to avoid possible has issue `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
	```
	...
	http {
    ...
    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
    ...
	}
	...

	```
	1. Test for syntax errors `sudo nginx -t`
	2. Restart the service `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
	3. Use `hostname -I` to get the ip and paste it on browser to see the welcome page

### 6. Setup shortcut
1. Create a file called config in `.ssh` directory on your main system
2. Insert the following lines to the config file
	```
	Host as1
		HostName 157.245.52.255
		User ftt1241
		Port 1241
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sop_as1
	```
3. Now you can connect to the vps via simple command `ssh as1`


### 7. Set timezone
1. Use the following command to set the timezone of the VPS to +8 GMT

	```
	sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Singapore
	```
